# Automated Proof Generation Using MeTTa and MeTTa-Motto

The paper presents SAFE (Self-evolving Automated prooF gEneration), a framework for automating formal verification of Rust code using the Verus verification tool. This approach could indeed be adapted using MeTTa's symbolic logic capabilities combined with LLM access through MeTTa-Motto to create a similar automated proof generation system.

## Combining MeTTa with LLMs for Proof Generation

MeTTa provides powerful symbolic reasoning capabilities, while MeTTa-Motto offers integration with LLMs. This combination is particularly well-suited for creating a proof generation system similar to SAFE because:

1. **MeTTa's symbolic logic** can handle formal assertions, unification, and logical inference - critical components for verification
2. **LLMs via MeTTa-Motto** can generate candidate proofs and interpret error messages for self-debugging

Let me outline how we could design such a system:

### 1. Architecture for Automated Proof Generation 

```
MeTTa Knowledge Base
    ↑↓
Function Specifications ← LLM Generation (MeTTa-Motto)
    ↑↓
Proof Generation ← LLM Generation (MeTTa-Motto)
    ↑↓
Verification (MeTTa symbolic execution)
    ↑↓
Error Feedback → Self-Debugging (LLM via MeTTa-Motto)
```

### 2. Key Components

#### a) Function Specification Generator

```metta
(= (generate-specification $function-code)
   (let $llm-response ((chat-gpt-agent) 
                       (system "Generate formal specifications for this function in MeTTa format.")
                       (user $function-code))
        (parse-specification $llm-response)))
```

#### b) Proof Generator

```metta
(= (generate-proof $function-code $specification)
   (let $llm-response ((chat-gpt-agent)
                       (system "Generate a formal proof that the function meets its specification.")
                       (user (concat-str "Function: " $function-code 
                                        "\nSpecification: " $specification)))
        (parse-proof $llm-response)))
```

#### c) Verification Engine

```metta
(= (verify-proof $function $specification $proof)
   (try-verify
     (match &self ($specification $function $proof) True)
     (lambda ($error) (Error $error))))
```

#### d) Self-Debugging

```metta
(= (debug-proof $function $specification $proof $error)
   (let $llm-debug-response ((chat-gpt-agent)
                            (system "Fix the proof based on the verification error.")
                            (user (concat-str "Function: " $function 
                                             "\nSpecification: " $specification
                                             "\nFailng proof: " $proof
                                             "\nError: " $error)))
        (parse-proof $llm-debug-response)))
```

#### e) Self-Evolution

```metta
(= (evolve-model $successful-proofs $debug-examples)
   (let $model (fine-tune-llm $successful-proofs $debug-examples)
        (bind! &proof-generator $model)))
```

## Application to Software Immune System

For identifying donor candidates in a software immune system, this proof generation approach offers several valuable capabilities:

### 1. Formal Property Verification

We can use the proof system to verify that potential donor functions satisfy required properties before transplantation:

```metta
(= (verify-donor-candidate $donor $required-properties)
   (let $specification (generate-specification $donor)
        (let $verified (all-properties-satisfied? $specification $required-properties)
             (if $verified
                 (suitable-donor $donor)
                 (unsuitable-donor $donor $missing-properties)))))
```

### 2. Equivalence Checking

The proof system can verify behavioral equivalence between donor and recipient code:

```metta
(= (check-behavioral-equivalence $donor $recipient)
   (let $donor-spec (generate-specification $donor)
        (let $recipient-spec (generate-specification $recipient)
             (let $equivalence-proof (generate-equivalence-proof $donor-spec $recipient-spec)
                  (verify-proof $donor $recipient $equivalence-proof)))))
```

### 3. Adaptation Verification

When adapting donor code to fit the recipient context, the proof system can verify that adaptations preserve essential properties:

```metta
(= (verify-adaptation $original-donor $adapted-donor $essential-properties)
   (let $original-spec (generate-specification $original-donor)
        (let $adapted-spec (generate-specification $adapted-donor)
             (let $preserved? (verify-property-preservation $original-spec $adapted-spec $essential-properties)
                  (if $preserved?
                      (valid-adaptation $adapted-donor)
                      (invalid-adaptation $adapted-donor $violated-properties))))))
```

### 4. Runtime Verification with Successful Executions

We can enhance the proof system with runtime evidence by incorporating successful function executions:

```metta
(= (incorporate-execution-evidence $function $inputs $outputs $states)
   (let $observations (map (lambda ($i $o $s) (Observation $i $o $s)) $inputs $outputs $states)
        (let $inferred-properties (infer-properties-from-observations $observations)
             (add-to-specifications $function $inferred-properties))))
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Knowledge Representation**: MeTTa would represent function specifications as formal assertions using its symbolic logic capabilities.

2. **Self-Evolving Training**: Following SAFE's approach, we would implement a self-evolving cycle where:
   - Initial proofs are generated by sophisticated LLM prompting
   - Successful proofs are used to fine-tune specialized LLMs
   - Error messages are used to create self-debugging training data

3. **Verification Engine**: MeTTa's symbolic execution capabilities would be used to verify proofs, similar to how Verus uses the Z3 SMT solver.

4. **Integration with Python**: The system could receive function execution traces from Python:
   ```metta
   (= (receive-python-execution $function $inputs $outputs $states)
      (add-atom &self (Execution $function $inputs $outputs $states)))
   ```

## Conclusion

The combination of MeTTa's symbolic reasoning capabilities with LLM access through MeTTa-Motto provides a powerful foundation for building an automated proof generation system similar to SAFE. This system could be particularly valuable for identifying and verifying donor candidates in a software immune system by ensuring that transplanted code meets formal specifications and preserves essential properties.

The self-evolving nature of this approach aligns well with the concept of an immune system - it can continually improve its ability to verify and adapt code through experience, much like a biological immune system becomes more effective over time.
